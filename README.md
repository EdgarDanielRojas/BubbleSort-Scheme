# BubbleSort-Scheme
Bubblesort and Quicksort implemented in the Scheme functional programming language.
## IDE Used
In order to run these programs you need some sort of interpreter, in our case we downloaded DrRacket from the website https://racket-lang.org/. You need to specify a language to be interpreted but I have already included in the file the language to be used.
## Inputs accepted
These sort algorithms only work with list elements in scheme. You can create one using ```(list element1 element2 ... elementn)``` or by using ```(cons elementtoprepend list)``` or any other operation that results in a list.
